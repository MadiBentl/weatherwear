Weatherwear is a web application built using the ipinfo.ip and Open Weather APIs that returns recommendations for a user's jogging apparel based on the weather at their location. The app takes details like temperature, weather conditions and wind intensity into consideration and produces recommendations for user's legs, torso, face, hands and head.
